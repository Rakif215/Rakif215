### 🧠 What Makes Me Tick

I'm on a mission to turn data into gold and algorithms into magic spells. My playground? The vast realms of AI and Machine Learning. When I'm not training models, you'll find me:

- 🔍 Hunting for patterns in seas of data
- 🏗️ Architecting neural networks that dream in binary
- 🎭 Teaching chatbots the art of witty conversation
- 🌈 Visualizing data in ways that would make Picasso proud

### 🎢 My AI Adventure Park

Step right up and witness the marvels of modern machine learning!

1. 🎡 **The LLama Whisperer**: Fine-tuned LLama models to understand the secret language of social media. 

2. 🎠 **The Diabetes Oracle**: Deployed a model on Azure that predicts the future (of blood sugar levels)

3. 🏰 **ChatWithSQL**: Built a magical bridge between humans and databases. Now SQL speaks your language!

4. 🌋 **Mind Reader 3000**: A chatbot that's part therapist, part fortune cookie. It's cheaper than therapy and more accurate than horoscopes!

5. 🚀 **The Knowledge Navigator**: A chatbot with RAG capabilities. It's like having a librarian, a search engine, and a witty friend all rolled into one.
