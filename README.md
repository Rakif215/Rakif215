# 👋 Hi, I'm Rakif Khan Pathan

🎓 I’m currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Germany. My academic journey focuses on machine learning, robotics, and data-driven systems — blending theory with practical applications in AI and automation.

🔍 My research interests lie at the intersection of language processing, sentiment modeling, and intelligent decision systems.
