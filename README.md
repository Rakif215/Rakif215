Hello! I’m Rakif Khan, a dedicated data science enthusiast with over 4 years of experience in coding and data analysis. Originally starting my career in web development, I've since shifted my focus to data science, where I thrive on uncovering insights through data. My technical toolkit includes advanced proficiency in Python, with extensive use of data manipulation and machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Pytorch and Tesorflow. I have also developed a personal cryptocurrency portfolio using PowerBI, which has enabled me to visually analyze and track crypto assets effectively. I'm particularly proud of my recent accomplishment where my research paper titled "A New Sentiment Analysis-based Approach for the Prediction of Users’ Beliefs" was accepted by IEEE. This paper explores innovative methods to predict user beliefs through sentiment analysis, contributing valuable insights to the field of data-driven decision making
